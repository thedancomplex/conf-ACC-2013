The two different control designs for reducing the effect of TR in coupled systems, RE and SMC, both
reduce the effect greatly. Table~\ref{table:resultsClosedLoop} shows the results from the control using RE 
and the control using SMC. These results show that RE reduces the $\Delta$ TR Mag over a
greater range than SMC does. However SMC has a $\Delta dB$ of $0dB$ over all of the ratios of $J_L:J_a$ while RE
continues to have the switching effect. It has also been shown that the SMC is effective for dealing with the load switching over a range of $J_L:J_a$ ratios.  The performance and simplicity of RE is good if you have access to the current $i_a$ state. If you only have access to the $\theta_a$ state and do not have a good model of the system then SMC is a valid choice.

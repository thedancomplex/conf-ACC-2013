 \section{Conclusion}\label{sec:con}
The two different control designs for reducing the effect of TR in coupled systems, RE and SMC, both
reduce the effect greatly. Table~\ref{table:resultsClosedLoop} shows the results from the control using RE 
and the control using SMC. These results show that RE reduces the TR Mag Change over a
greater range than SMC does. However SMC has a $\Delta dB$ of $0dB$ over all of the ratios of $J_L:J_a$ while RE
continues to have the switching effect.

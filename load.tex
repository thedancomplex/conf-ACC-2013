\section{Effects of TR}\label{sec:load}
\subsection{Effect as Seen at the Actuator}
The dipping and peaking of the magnitude of the frequency response plot of a system with TR is not the
only effect that TR has on the system. Another effect is a change in the effective load seen by the system
before $\omega_{ar}$ to after $\omega_r$, see Fig.~\ref{fig:trBode}. Before the $\omega_{ar}$ the acting inertial load on the system is the sum of the
actuator’s inertial load, $J_a$, and the load’s inertial load, $J_L$. This is a second order system with a slope of
negative $40\frac{dB}{dec}$ on the frequency response plot. After the $\omega_{r}$ the acting inertial load is only the
actuator’s inertia, $J_a$, which also defines a second order system with a slope of negative $40\frac{dB}{dec}$ on the
frequency response plot. The latter characteristics can be seen in the frequency response plot in Fig.~\ref{fig:trBode}.

\noindent Transfer function for a mass spring damper system with effective load of $J_a+J_L$, ideal coupler (pre-$\omega_{ar}$)

\begin{equation}
\frac{\theta_{J_a+J_L}(s)}{T(s)}=\frac{1}{(J_a+J_L)s^2}
\end{equation}

\noindent Transfer function for a mass spring damper system with effective load of $J_a$, ideal coupler (post-$\omega_{r}$)
\begin{equation}
\frac{\theta_{J_a(s)}}{T(s)}=\frac{1}{J_as^2}
\end{equation}


It can be noted that there is an offset between the frequency responses of the second order estimations of
the system with TR when going from before the $\omega_{ar}$ to after the $\omega_{r}$ when looking at the magnitude in $dB$ of
the response. This offset, known as gain separation, means that there is a parameter, in this case the
effective inertia on the system, which is changing. Fig.~\ref{fig:trBode} shows the frequency response of the system
with TR from Eq.~\ref{eq:tf} and values from Table~\ref{table:defaultVals} with the added frequency responses of a systems with out
TR but having the effective load as $J_L+J_a$ and $J_a$.  This is referred to as load switching.

\subsection{Effect on Velocity}

When there is a step torque command input to the system, like that seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:torqueIn} (top), the output velocity
exhibits an oscillatory behavior. The frequency of oscillation is expected to be equal to $\omega_r$ of the system
from Eq.~\ref{eq:tf}. Therefore this should have a ripple frequency of 201.4 rad/sec, 32.1 Hz.

\end{figure}


Fig.\ref{fig:trap} shows Fig.~\ref{fig:torqueIn} magnified about 1.5 sec to 2 sec. The angular velocity of
the actuator shaft has a decaying sinusoid on it due to the resonance and the spring/damping.  
The period of is 0.031sec (32.2 Hz, 202.3 rad/sec). This frequency is the
same as the $\omega_r$ computed in Eq.\ref{eq:tf}, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:trBode} and uses the values in Table~\ref{table:defaultVals}.  
This frequency $\omega_n$ can by calculated by

\begin{equation}
\omega_n=\sqrt{\frac{K_c(J_a+J_L)}{J_aJ_L}}
\end{equation}
